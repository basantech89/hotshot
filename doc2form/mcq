Telnet is a service used for remote logins and runs on port 23 by default. An attacker is attempting to telnet into a corporation’s system. The attacker doesn’t want to get caught and is spoofing his IP address. After numerous tries he remains unsuccessful in connecting to the system. The attacker rechecks that the target system is actually listening on port 23 and he verifies it with nmap. He is still unable to connect to the target system. What is the most probable reason ?
The firewall is blocking port 23 to that system. 
He cannot spoof his IP and successfully use TCP. 
He needs to use an automated tool to telnet in.
